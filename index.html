                    Angela Yu is a developer with a passion for teaching. She's the founder and lead instructor at the London App Brewery (LAB), London's leading Programming Bootcamp. After studying medicine to become an NHS doctor, she decided to start teaching people; She's helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming developers. Twitter, Facebook and Google have invited her to teach their employees, and they also worked together to create an updated curriculum.

                   <p>
                    She got into programming at just 12 years old because she wanted to build her own Space Invader game. Since then, she's made websites, apps and games in the hundreds. But most importantly, she realized that her greatest passion lies in teaching.

                   <p>
                    She has spent a lot of time researching how to make learning to code fun and make complex concepts easy to understand, which she applied to her Bootcamp courses. You'll find lots of geeky humour in her lessons and lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.
